                Hi, I’m a passionate software developer who truly enjoys the world of coding. <br>
                Whether I’m building something new or solving complex problems, <br>
                I find real excitement in writing clean, efficient code. <br>
                Outside of tech, I’m a huge soccer fan—playing the game is one of my favorite hobbies, <br>
                and I love watching matches whenever I get the chance. <br>
                Balancing my love for programming with the energy and fun of soccer keeps me motivated and inspired every day.
